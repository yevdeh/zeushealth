<strong style="font-size: 18px;">17. MISCELLANEOUS</strong></br></br>
17.1. These Terms and any policies or operating rules posted by us at the Service constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others at any time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control.</br></br>
17.2. If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship created between you and us as a result of these Terms or use of the Service.</br></br>
17.3. We may transfer or assign any and all of its rights and obligations under these Terms to any other person, by any way, including by novation, and by accepting these Terms you give us consent to any such assignment and transfer. You confirm that placing on the Service of a version of these Terms indicating another person as a party to the Terms shall constitute valid notice to you of the transfer of our rights and obligations under the Terms (unless otherwise is expressly indicated).</br></br>
17.4. You agree that these Terms will not be construed against us by virtue of having drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may have based on the electronic form of these Terms and the lack of signing by the parties hereto to execute these Terms.</br></br></br>
